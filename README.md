# Eurozone Sovereign-Bank Nexus
This repository contains data and code used in my MSc Finance dissertation:
"The Sovereign-Bank Nexus in the Eurozone: Banking Stability and Sovereign Debt Crises"
It explores the relationship between sovereign debt crises and the performance of banking stocks in the Eurozone using panel regression and event study methods.
## 📘 Project Summary
This study investigates two key questions:
1. Do sovereign bond yields act as a leading or lagging indicator of bank stress?
2. How do sovereign credit rating changes affect Eurozone bank stock returns?
## 🧠 Methodology
- **Panel Regression**: Tests the relationship between sovereign bond yields, return volatility, NPL ratios, and bank stock returns
- **Event Study**: Measures short-term market reaction (CAR) to sovereign credit rating upgrades and downgrades
